## Identify Build commandBased on the `${out_dir}` and `${build_target}` determine the exact command tobuild the test using the syntax `autoninja out -C out/{out_dir} {build_target}`.- For example: if the `${out_dir}` is `debug_x64`, the command will be:  `autoninja -k 0 -C out/debug_x64 build_target`## Build and fix compile errorsYou **must** run the build command to build the code after making the changes.- If you encounter **any** compile errors, fix them before continuing and build  again. This may involve adding or removing includes, changing method  signatures, or adjusting the test logic to match the new browser test  framework.- It is expected that you will encounter some compile errors, so be prepared to  fix them iteratively and build again if if necessary.### Example Build ErrorsIf you encounter any build errors you could not fix in one try, that it wouldhave been helpful to have generic examples for, let the user know thatthey can update this prompt to include this information in the future for fasterfixes.
